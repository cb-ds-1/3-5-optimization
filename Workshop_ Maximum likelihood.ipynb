    "# 1. Bisection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common algorithms for numerical root-finding is *bisection*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the idea, recall the well-known game where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player A thinks of a secret number between 1 and 100  \n",
    "- Player B asks if it’s less than 50  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - If yes, B asks if it’s less than 25  \n",
    "  - If no, B asks if it’s less than 75  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is bisection, a relative of [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). It works for all sufficiently well behaved increasing continuous functions with $ f(a) < 0 < f(b) $. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write an implementation of the bisection algorith, `bisect(f, lower, upper, tol)` which, given a function `f`, a lower bound `lower` and an upper bound `upper` finds the point `x` where `f(x) = 0`. The parameter `tol` is a numerical tolerance, you should stop once your step size is smaller than `tol`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use it to minimize the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sin(4 (x - 1/4)) + x + x^{20} - 1 \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in python: `lambda x: np.sin(4 * (x - 1/4)) + x + x**20 - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The value where f(x) = 0 should be around `0.408`"
